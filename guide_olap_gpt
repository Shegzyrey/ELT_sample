Sure, let's break down the assignment into step-by-step tasks and identify suitable technologies and tools for each. We'll also consider creating a Docker solution for ease of deployment.
Step 1: Operational Database (OLTP)

    Database Selection:
        Choose a relational database for OLTP. Examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
    Database Schema:
        Create a simple database schema with at least one table.
        Use a tool like DBeaver or pgAdmin for database schema design and management.

Step 2: Data Filling Procedure or Service

    Data Source:
        Choose a data source (API or random value generator).
    Data Loading:
        Create a script or service to fill the operational database with data periodically.
        Use a programming language like Python or Node.js.
        Utilize tools like Flask for API development or Faker for random data generation.

Step 3: Analytical Database (OLAP)

    Database Selection:
        Choose a data warehousing solution like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake.
    Database Schema:
        Design a star or snowflake schema with fact and dimensional tables.
        Use tools like dbt (data build tool) for analytics engineering.

Step 4: Data Replication Solution

    Replication Method:
        Choose between batch or streaming replication.
        For batch replication, consider tools like Apache NiFi or Talend.
        For streaming replication, consider Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.
    Replication Delay:
        Introduce a delay in the batch replication process.
    Docker Container:
        Create Docker containers for the replication processes.

Step 5: Data Transformation

    Transformation Logic:
        Create a script or job to transform operational data into analytical data.
        Use tools like Apache Spark or dbt for data transformations.
    Regular Execution:
        Schedule the transformation job to run regularly (e.g., using cron).

Step 6: Replication Monitoring System

    Monitoring Tool:
        Choose a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Grafana.
        Set up dashboards to visualize replication runs, success/failure, etc.
    Alerting:
        Implement alerting for replication failures.

Step 7: Docker Solution

    Docker Compose:
        Create a Docker Compose file to define the services (databases, replication processes, monitoring tools).
        Use Docker images for chosen databases and tools.
    Container Orchestration:
        Utilize Docker Compose for local development and testing.
        Optionally, explore container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Step 8: Documentation

    Instructions:
        Provide clear documentation on how to deploy and run the solution.
        Include steps for setting up the Docker environment.
        Specify any configuration parameters.

Step 9: Additional Enhancements (if time permits)

    Data Security:
        Implement data encryption in transit and at rest.
        Explore role-based access control (RBAC) for databases.
    Performance Optimization:
        Fine-tune database configurations for better performance.
        Consider indexing strategies.

Note:

    Tool Flexibility:
        Feel free to adjust the choice of tools based on your expertise and preferences.
    Non-Production Ready:
        Keep in mind that this solution is not intended for production but should showcase design thinking and skills within the given timeframe.
    Iterative Approach:
        If you identify areas for improvement during the process, feel free to iterate on the design.

This step-by-step guide covers the major components of the assignment. Adjustments can be made based on specific preferences and expertise.
